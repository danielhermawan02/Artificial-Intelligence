## i.    01_basicTicTakToe.py
In this program, the loction to make a move is chosen randomly.

## ii.   02_miniMaxTicTakToe.py
In this program, the loction to make a move is chosen by miniMax approach. 
Hence it is impossible to beat the AI. Either AI will win or game will draw.

## iii.  03_packmanDFS.py  
In this program, pacman is simulated and its way to find its goal to end node is demonstarated by using Depth first search Algorithm.  
Yellow Ball - Pacman. 
Red Node - Goal Node.  
Blue Nodes - Walls.  
Green Nodes - Searching the path.   
Pink Nodes - Path taken.  

The working of this appraoch [has been uploaded on this YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vWjmX9M5rg)

Following 2 images show the start and end states respectively-

## iv.   04_packmanBFS.py
In this program, pacman is simulated and its way to find its goal to end node is demonstarated by using Breath first search Algorithm.  
Yellow Ball - Pacman. 
Red Node - Goal Node.  
Blue Nodes - Walls.  
Green Nodes - Searching the path.   
Pink Nodes - Path taken.
