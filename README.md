## A. 01_basicTicTakToe.py
In this program, the loction to make a move is chose randomly.

## B. 02_miniMaxTicTakToe.py
In this program, the loction to make a move is chosen by miniMax approach. 
Hence it is impossible to beat the AI. Either AI will win or game will draw.

## C. 03_packmanDFS.py   
In this program, pacman is simulated and its way to find its goal to end node is demonstarated by using Depth first search Algorithm.  
Yellow Ball - Pacman. 
Red Node - Goal Node.  
Blue Nodes - Walls.  
Green Nodes - Searching the path.   
Pink Nodes - Path taken.
